While many can pursue their dreams in solitude, other dreams are like great storms 
blowing hundreds, even thousands of dreams apart in their wake. Dreams breathe life 
into men and can cage them in suffering. Men live and die by their dreams. But long 
after they have been abandoned they still smolder deep in men's hearts. Some see nothing 
more than life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.

The wisdom that sleeps
In the written word
Is overcome by a despair
That lurks within
